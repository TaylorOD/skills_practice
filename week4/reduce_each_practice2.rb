#  1. Start with an array of numbers and compute the sum of all the numbers.
#     For example, [5, 10, 8, 3] becomes 26.
#     Use .each and .reduce

# numbers = [5, 10, 8, 3]
# product = 1
# numbers.each do |num|
#   product = product * num
# end

# p product

# numbers = [5, 10, 8, 3]

# product = numbers.reduce(1) do |product, num|
#   product * num
# end

# p product
